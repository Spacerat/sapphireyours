<H2> Sapphire Yours - What's New ? </H2>

This page is intended to act as a journal for all news 
related to the game Sapphire Yous and to document the  
development progress. The entries are written in chronological
order from bottom to top so that you can see the newest entries at first 
glance.
<HR>

<H3> 25.8.2001 - Version 3.1 released </H3>

Due to the moving of the homepage we were also 
forced to release a new version of the game
(because all links to the old homepage did not work 
anymore of course). 
Nevertheless there are also some minor bug fixes and
a very improved "Graphite" graphics set. This 
new artwork has been done by Jürgen Bonhagen
and is really cool - so try it out (change
the game settings in the main menu).

<H3> 25.8.2001 - Homepage has moved yet again </H3>

Unluckily our new web space provider ceased operation 
5 weeks after we moved the Sapphire Yours Homepage to it.
<br>
So we had to move again...  <em>(sigh)</em>
<br>
This new location (<code>members.aon.at/sapphire</code>)
should be a little more stable now.

<H3> 30.6.2001 - Version 3.0 released </H3>

Features of the new version:
<ul>
<li>The "Pusher" </li>
<li>Additional artwork and soundsets integrated 
directly into base package </li>
<li>As always: New levels </li>
</ul>


<H3> 24.6.2001 - New address of the Sapphire Yours Homepage </H3>

"XPoint" cancelled its operation on private customers and
small bussinesses. Therefore the homepage had to move to
this new location.

<H3> 11.2.2001 - Swapping place for levels </H3>

From now on the "Levels!" section of the Sapphire Yours homepage
gives all users the possibility to make their self-designed
levels available to the public.

<H3> 16.10.2000 - Version 2.9 released </H3>

After many months of programming and development we finally
came to a new version with all the promised features
und much more: <BR>
<ul>
<li>Fully integrated level editor </li>
<li>Level category system </li>
<li>Mouse support for menu selection </li>
<li>New music</li>
<li>Additional graphics and sound set </li>
<li>VCR mode is now easier to handle</li>
<li>Additional game element: elevator</li>
<li>Movement counter</li>
<li>Customiseable special graphics objects</li>
<li>Many, many more levels</li>
</ul>
 

<H3> Summer 2000 - Version 2.9 in developement </H3>
In preparation for a version 3.0 that will also
be available for linux, the 2.9 for windows
will come with: <BR>
An integrated level editor <BR>
Enhanced menu handling <BR>
Mouse support <BR>
and as usual much more levels <BR> 

<H3> 15.4.2000 - Version 2.1 released </H3>

This new version finally has support for: <BR>
Multiple languages (englisch and german by now) <BR>
Joystick input <BR>
Different screen resolutions <BR>
Various text font sizes <BR>
Adjustable image sizes <BR>
<BR>
And of course there are many more new levels in the game.

<H3> 5.3.2000 - New layout of the homepage </H3>

<H3> 20.1.2000 - Development start of 2.1 </H3>

The next release will be available before 13.4.2000 which is 
the deadline for a shareware contest running at
our main distributor 
<A href="http://hotfiles.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/hotfiles/info.html?fcode=0014RY"
TARGET="_top">
zdnet.com</A>. 
This release will include support for multiple languages,
enhanced sound output, improved graphics and of course much more levels.

<H3> 17.12.1999 - Version 2.0 released </H3>

Just in time for christmas, the newest version of Sapphire Yours comes 
with a full load of enhancements:<BR><BR>
New main menu and level selection <BR>
Faster graphic engine and adaptive frame rate<BR>
Original Sapphire Yours game music <BR>
New game elements: Robots, beetles, quicksand <BR>
Christmas artwork <BR>
More levels <BR>
and much more ... <BR>

<H3> 11.11.1999 - Version 2.0 nearly completed </H3>

Most of the programming has now been finished. The main focus now is on
improving the artwork and the music. Also some work on the levels 
and the level editor is still necessary.


<H3> September 1999 - Development start of version 2.0 </H3>

The version 2.0 will be available somewhere around christmas 1999. <BR>
<BR>
Most important features: <BR>
Completely re-written graphics engine (faster, more consistent) <BR>
Improved main menu <BR>
New levels <BR>
New game objects (beetles) <BR>
Visible VCR tracks <BR>
Demo editing capabilities <BR>


<H3> 28.6.1999 - Version 1.1 released </H3>

Many new levels <BR>
New game objects (cushion, ruby) <BR>
Minor changes in the graphics <BR>
Enhanced managment of finished/known state of levels <BR>
Suspended games <BR>


<H3> 29.4.1999 - Version 1.0 released (the Birthday Version) </H3>

First official release <BR>

<H3> 1.3.1999 - New name for the game </H3>

Until now, I always used the name "Reinhard's Emerald Mine" as product name
for my game, but I have been finally convinced to choose a name that
will not bring us in conflict with Kingsoft. <BR>
This way "Sapphire Yours" was born.

<H3> 10.2.1999 - Start of the DirectX version </H3>

Until this date, the whole development of the game is done on a 
DOS PC using TurboPascal.
Porting the game logic from Pascal to C and the graphics engine
from direct VGA-register programming to DirectX will eat up the next month 
of development.
