Level Categories
----------------

The Level categories are meant to give a hint about the general feel of the level (indepedent of difficulty).
Often a level fits into more than one category, there use the one you feel most appropriate.


1 Travel:   ("The Maze")
   Most important part of the game is to move around in a big level which can very well be a maze and find
   all relevant things and not get lost in the process.
   
2 Action:   ("Virulent Desease")
   Swift action is needed to overcome some global time constraints or at smaller parts that need
   to be solved individually.

3 Fight:   ("War")
   Enemies (Lorries, Swamp, YamYams, etc.) are to be killed or excessively avoided.
    
4: Puzzle   ("Königsberg")
   Find a way to work with the given objects in the correct way to solve the level. The behavior of the
   individual objects is easy to understand but the difficulty arises from the multitude of objects
   available.    
    
5: Science   ("Mission Possible")
   Need to exploit behavior of objects or enemies that are not obvious.    
   
6: "Work"  ("Gravel Pit")
   Need to do much repeating work to get the level solved. It may be clear what to do, but the amount
   of actions (mostly pushing around stones) is excessive.
