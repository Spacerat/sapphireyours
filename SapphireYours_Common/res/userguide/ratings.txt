Difficulty Rating Guidelines
----------------------------

For the matter this guideline, the solve needs to be done without aiding features (Undo, Single-Step).

1 Simple: "Basic mining"
Almost nothing to do wrong. Look at it - solve it.
Only novice players may need more than one attempt. 

2 Easy: "Welcome to the game"
Only minor difficulties. If any traps, they are fairly obvious. 
Straight solution possible. 

3 Moderate: "Adventure in a Bag"
Should be a challenge for novice players.
One or more of:
 - A few time-critical moves or traps that are not too easy to avoid at first. 
 - A solution that requires some strategy.
 - Have to be quite fast to solve that level. 

4 Normal: "The Far Side"
Requires some experience. Solution possible after a few attempts.
One or more of: 
 - Contains some time-critical moves. 
 - Traps not easy to avoid. 
 - Solution requires considerable thinking. 
 - Available time or other limiting factors are less than 150 % of theoretical minimum. 

5 Tricky: "Find the way out"
Virtually impossible for novice players!
Experienced players may need more than one attempt to solve it. 
One or more of:
 - Rely on special time-critical moves or a time-critical sequence of moves. 
 - Rely on features of the game that are not obvious. 
 - Contain enemies, have large play field, are difficult to navigate through etc. 
 - Traps difficult to avoid at first. 
 - Rely on optimal use of time-bombs. 

6 Tough: "Strip Mining II"
Even experienced players will need more than one attempt.
One or more of:
 - The whole level is time-critical. 
 - Rely on features of the game that rarely occur in normal playing.
 - Time-critical sequences essential for solution.
 - Solution requires special techniques.
 - Rely on optimal use of most of the given resources.
 - Traps are difficult to avoid. 

7 Difficult: "The Swamp-Bridge"
A challenge for experienced players.
One or more of:
 - Tough time-limit.
 - Enemies are a real trouble.
 - Rely on features of the game that almost never occur in normal playing.
 - Whole solution is a time-critical sequence. 
 - Solution requires a few optimal time-critical sequences.
 - Rely on optimal use of all given resources.
 - Requires a special approach to most of the given problems.
 - Parts of the level seem impossible to solve at first.* 

8 Hard: "Level 42"
Virtually impossible even for experienced players.
One or more of:
 - Extremely tough time-limit. 
 - Rely on obscure features of the game.
 - Solution consists of a series of time-critical sequences.
 - Solution requires a lot of optimal time-critical sequences.
 - Solution seems almost impossible.* 

9 M.A.D. (maximum acceptable difficulty): "The Balance III"
A majority of experienced players would not find a solution for this level or at least be unable to play it.
One or more of:
- Rely on extremely strange features of the game.
- Need time-critical moves in order to work with these features.
- Time-limit based on optimal number of moves.
- Solution requires knowledge of internal representation of level data or states.
- Solution requires series of optimal time-critical sequences.
- Whole solution is an optimal time-critical sequence.
- Solution seems impossible even for very experienced players after dozens of attempts.
